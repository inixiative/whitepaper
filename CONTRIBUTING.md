# Contributing to Project Inixiative

Thank you for your interest in improving this work! This whitepaper benefits from diverse perspectives, rigorous critique, and collaborative refinement.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Feedback & Critique

**What we want:**
- Theoretical challenges to the diagnosis or mechanisms
- Evidence that contradicts claims
- Identification of logical gaps or inconsistencies
- Alternative frameworks we should consider
- Real-world examples that support or refute the thesis

**How to provide it:**
- Open an issue on GitHub describing the specific concern
- Reference section numbers (e.g., "Section 2.3 claims X, but evidence Y suggests...")
- Provide citations for empirical claims
- Be specific: "this is unclear" is less helpful than "Section 4.2's definition of subsidiarity conflicts with usage in Section 6.9"

### 2. Corrections & Improvements

**We appreciate:**
- Typo fixes
- Broken cross-references
- Factual errors (with sources for corrections)
- Unclear explanations (suggest rewording)
- Missing citations

**How to submit:**
- For small fixes: Open a pull request with the change
- For larger edits: Open an issue first to discuss approach
- Follow the existing writing style (materialist framing, clinical tone, minimal jargon)

### 3. Additional Research & Evidence

**Helpful additions:**
- Case studies supporting or challenging mechanisms
- Historical examples of governance experiments
- Empirical data on cooperation, institutions, or collective action
- Cross-disciplinary insights (biology, economics, systems theory, etc.)

**How to contribute:**
- Open an issue proposing the addition with summary
- Provide sources and suggested placement
- Explain how it strengthens (or challenges) the argument

### 4. Mechanism Design Proposals

**Novel governance mechanisms:**
- Explain the problem it solves
- Describe how it shifts Schelling points (equilibria)
- Identify attack surfaces and mitigations
- Provide theoretical justification or empirical evidence
- Acknowledge failure modes

**Where it belongs:**
- Section 5 (Proven Mechanisms): Only if empirically validated at scale
- Section 6 (Novel Mechanisms): Theoretically sound but unproven
- Clearly label epistemic status: "this works" vs "this should work"

### 5. Implementation Feedback

**For builders/developers:**
- Technical architecture critiques (Section 7.3)
- Security concerns
- UX suggestions
- Alternative technical approaches
- Smart contract design patterns

**For potential users:**
- Use case validation ("would this actually work for X?")
- Adoption barriers we haven't considered
- Feature requests (with justification)

## What We're NOT Looking For

**Please avoid:**
- Ideological arguments without empirical grounding
- Proposals that prescribe "the solution" (we're building infrastructure for search, not imposing answers)
- Feature creep (adding complexity without demonstrated need)
- Utopian claims or revolution rhetoric
- Ad hominem attacks or dismissals of entire fields

## Writing Guidelines

**Tone:**
- Clinical, not idealistic
- Materialist framing (structural incentives, not good intentions)
- Acknowledge uncertainty and failure modes
- Present evidence, let readers draw conclusions

**Structure:**
- Use section references for cross-document navigation
- Include citations for empirical claims
- Define technical terms on first use
- Distinguish between "proven" and "speculative" mechanisms

**Markdown:**
- Use `**bold**` for emphasis, not *italics*
- Code blocks for examples, pseudocode, or data
- Bullet lists for clarity
- Headers: ## for sections, ### for subsections, #### for sub-subsections

## Review Process

1. **Issues:** Discussed openly; maintainer responds within 1 week
2. **Pull Requests:** Small fixes merged quickly; larger changes require discussion
3. **Major Changes:** Structural revisions discussed in issues before PR
4. **Final Authority:** Project lead reserves right to maintain coherent vision while incorporating feedback

**This is a living document.** The whitepaper will evolve as we learn from real-world deployment, empirical feedback, and community input. We're building a map, not a destination—your corrections help us navigate accurately.
