# Project Inixiative: Table of Contents

**Adaptive Governance Infrastructure for Cooperative Societies**

---

## Overview

This project consists of four core documents that build a comprehensive case for new governance infrastructure:

1. **[The Diagnosis](01_diagnosis.md)** - Why current governance systems fail
2. **[The Specification](02_specification.md)** - Requirements for any functional cooperative society
3. **[The Mechanisms](03_mechanisms.md)** - Design space of novel governance primitives
4. **[The MVP](04_mvp.md)** - Concrete implementation, roadmap, and risks

---

## Executive Summary

Modern societies experience cyclical breakdown due to elite overproduction, institutional bloat, cooperation decay, and competitive overload. Yet we lack concrete alternatives—not because good governance is impossible, but because we've lacked the technological infrastructure to make cooperation cheap and scalable.

This whitepaper proposes **Inixiative**: a cooperation-as-a-service platform enabling communities to experiment with novel governance mechanisms made possible by smart contracts and web3 infrastructure.

### Structure

This work is organized into four documents:

**Document 1: The Diagnosis (Sections 1-2)** — An exploration of why current governance systems fail, drawing on structural demography, institutional economics, cybernetics, and social cooperation theory. We identify the core failure modes: elite hypertrophy, institutional sclerosis, competition saturation, and the loss of subsidiarity.

**Document 2: The Specification (Sections 3-4)** — A formal schema defining what any functional governance system must accomplish—independent of implementation. This serves as an interface specification, an abstract API for cooperation at scale.

**Document 3: The Mechanisms (Section 5)** — Examples of governance mechanisms that were previously impossible but are now feasible through smart contracts: long-horizon accountability, programmable incentives, trustless execution, and transparent lifecycle management. These are tools, not prescriptions—communities mix and match as needed.

**Document 4: The MVP (Sections 6-9)** — A practical implementation focused on low-friction cooperation at scale. Not a replacement for government, but infrastructure for collective action: resource pooling, decision-making, and project coordination with dramatically reduced transaction costs.

### Core Thesis

We cannot prescribe the optimal governance system—that would be hubris. Instead, we provide tools to search the solution space. Smart contracts enable mechanisms for cooperation that were impossible in previous eras. By offering modular, composable governance primitives, communities can discover what works for them.

**Success metric:** participant satisfaction over time.

**Expected outcomes:** higher civic capacity, reduced coordination friction, evolutionary discovery of better institutional forms through experimentation rather than ideology.
