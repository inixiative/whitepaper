# Project Inixiative: Table of Contents

**Adaptive Governance Infrastructure for Cooperative Societies**

---

## Overview

This project consists of three core documents that build a comprehensive case for new governance infrastructure:

1. **[The Diagnosis](01_diagnosis.md)** - Why current governance systems fail
2. **[The Specification](02_specification.md)** - Requirements for any functional cooperative society
3. **[The Implementation](03_implementation.md)** - A concrete MVP proposal with mechanisms and risks

---

## Document 1: The Diagnosis

**File:** `01_diagnosis.md` (~1,400 lines, ~22,000 words)

- 2.6 Fatigue of Legacy Governance Models
- 2.7 Why Previous Reform Attempts Failed

---

## Document 2: The Specification

**File:** `02_specification.md` (to be extracted from whitepaper.md)

**Purpose:** Defines the requirements for any functional cooperative society as an abstract API—independent of implementation.

### Contents

#### Section 3: Design Frameworks & Methodologies
- 3.1 Evolutionary Light Cones: What Can Mechanisms See?
- 3.2 Incentive Design: Rules Shape Behavior More Than Leaders Do
- 3.3 Complex Systems & Emergence: Designing for the Unpredictable

- 3.5 Problem Space Navigation: Search, Don't Solve

#### Section 4: Principles of a Cooperative Society (System Requirements Spec)
- 4.1 Definitions
- 4.2 Make Cooperation Cheap
- 4.3 Make Defection Costly
- 4.4 Maintain Thin, Dynamic Elites
- 4.5 Enforce Subsidiarity Through Approval-Based Jurisdiction
- 4.6 Lifecycle Management for All Institutions
- 4.7 Voluntary Association by Design
- 4.8 Continuous Adaptation
- 4.9 Cohesion Without Uniformity
- 4.10 Resist the Tyranny of Metrics

---

## Document 3: The Implementation

**File:** `03_implementation.md` (to be extracted from whitepaper.md)

**Purpose:** Concrete mechanisms, MVP design, roadmap, and failure mode analysis.

## How to Read This Work

**For General Readers:** Start with Section 1.0 (Origin Story) in the Diagnosis, then read Section 2 (What Fails). This gives you the "why this matters" foundation.

**For Academics/Researchers:** Read the full Diagnosis (Sections 0-2) for theoretical grounding, then jump to the Specification (Sections 3-4) for the formal requirements framework.

**For Builders/Developers:** Read Section 2 (Diagnosis summary), skim Section 4 (Requirements Spec), then focus on the Implementation (Sections 5-9) for concrete mechanisms and architecture.

**For Investors/Evaluators:** Read Section 1.0 (Origin Story), Section 2 (Diagnosis), Section 6 (MVP), Section 7 (Roadmap), and Section 8 (Risks).
