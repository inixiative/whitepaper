# Project Inixiative: Table of Contents

**Adaptive Governance Infrastructure for Cooperative Societies**

---

## Overview

This project consists of four core documents that build a comprehensive case for new governance infrastructure:

1. **[The Diagnosis](01_diagnosis.md)** - Why current governance systems fail
2. **[The Specification](02_specification.md)** - Requirements for any functional cooperative society
3. **[The Mechanisms](03_mechanisms.md)** - Design space of novel governance primitives
4. **[The MVP](04_mvp.md)** - Concrete implementation, roadmap, and risks

---

## Document 1: The Diagnosis

**File:** `01_diagnosis.md` (~1,400 lines, ~22,000 words)

---

## Document 2: The Specification

**File:** `02_specification.md` (~36,000 words)

**Purpose:** Defines the requirements for any functional cooperative society as an abstract API—independent of implementation.

### Contents

#### Section 3: Design Frameworks & Methodologies
- 3.1 Evolutionary Light Cones: What Can Mechanisms See?
- 3.2 Incentive Design: Rules Shape Behavior More Than Leaders Do
- 3.3 Complex Systems & Emergence: Designing for the Unpredictable
- 3.4 Engineering Mindset: Build, Measure, Iterate
- 3.5 Problem Space Navigation: Search, Don't Solve

#### Section 4: Principles of a Cooperative Society (System Requirements Spec)
- 4.1 Make Cooperation Cheap
- 4.2 Make Defection Costly
- 4.3 Maintain Thin, Dynamic Elites
- 4.4 Enforce Subsidiarity Through Approval-Based Jurisdiction
- 4.5 Lifecycle Management for All Institutions
- 4.6 Voluntary Association by Design
- 4.7 Continuous Adaptation
- 4.8 Cohesion Without Uniformity
- 4.9 Resist the Tyranny of Metrics
- 4.10 Capture Preference Intensity, Not Just Direction
- 4.11 Protect Individual Sovereignty Through Rights Subsidiarity

## Document 3: The Mechanisms

**File:** `03_mechanisms.md` (~25,000 words)

**Purpose:** Explores the design space of novel governance primitives now possible through smart contracts and cryptographic infrastructure. This is the research catalog, not the implementation blueprint.

### Contents

#### Section 5: Novel Mechanisms Now Possible
- 5.1 Definitions
- 5.2 Identity & KYC Layer
- 5.3 Allocation & Voting Mechanisms
- 5.4 Solving the Principal–Agent Problem
- 5.5 Reputation & Reciprocity Engine
- 5.6 Continuous Alignment Mechanism
- 5.7 Point Voting as Political Will Translation
- 5.8 Delegation & Agentic Participation
- 5.9 Jurisdiction & Overlap Resolution
- 5.10 Initiative Creation
- 5.11 Anti-Capture Architecture
- 5.12 Why These Mechanisms Are Now Possible
- 5.13 Platform Philosophy: Humility and Experimentation

## Document 4: The MVP

**File:** `04_mvp.md` (~14,000 words)

**Purpose:** Concrete implementation blueprint—what we're actually building, the minimum viable product, roadmap from theory to deployment, and comprehensive risk analysis.

### Contents

#### Section 6: MVP: Low-Friction Cooperation at Scale
- 6.1 MVP Scope: What We're Building First
- 6.2 Core Features (Minimum Viable)
- 6.3 Technical Architecture
- 6.4 User Flow (Step-by-Step)

- 7.1 Phase 1: Theory + Whitepaper
- 7.2 Phase 2: MVP — Cooperation Infrastructure
- 7.3 Phase 3: Community Pilots & Iteration
- 7.4 Phase 4: Scaling & Advanced Features
- 7.5 Phase 5: Parallel Civic Ecosystems

#### Section 8: Risks, Limitations & Failure Modes
- 8.1 Capture (Elite or Special Interest Takeover)
- 8.2 Gaming (Mechanism Manipulation)
- 8.3 Overcomplexity (Illegibility to Ordinary Users)
- 8.4 The Rubric Problem (Measurement Becomes Control)
- 8.5 Goodhart's Law & Second-Order Effects

## How to Read This Work

**For General Readers:** Start with Section 1.0 (Origin Story) in the Diagnosis, then read Section 2 (What Fails). This gives you the "why this matters" foundation.

**For Academics/Researchers:** Read the full Diagnosis (Sections 0-2) for theoretical grounding, then jump to the Specification (Sections 3-4) for the formal requirements framework.

**For Builders/Developers:** Read Section 2 (Diagnosis summary), skim Section 4 (Requirements Spec), browse the Mechanisms catalog (Document 3), then focus on the MVP (Document 4) for concrete architecture and implementation plan.

**For Investors/Evaluators:** Read Section 1.0 (Origin Story), Section 2 (Diagnosis), then jump to Document 4 for the MVP, Roadmap, and Risks sections.
