# AI Project Instructions: Adaptive Governance Architecture

This document serves as the Project Specification and Operating System for all AI-assisted tasks related to the Project Inixiative whitepaper, which proposes a system of modular, adaptive governance anchored by Inixiatives (projects) and Instituxions (ongoing structures).

## 1. Project Core & Philosophy

| Component | Specification |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Project Goal** | Diagnose structural civilizational failure (Elite Bloat, Institutional Sclerosis, Cooperation Decay) and propose a unified, mechanistic, cybernetic solution: a Cooperation-as-a-Service microdemocracy app. |
| **Core Thesis** | Scalable, durable cooperation can be restored by making it structurally cheap and by enforcing institutional lifecycle management and long-horizon accountability on elites. |
| **Key Concepts** | Inixiative (discrete project), Instituxion (ongoing structure), Cooperation Engine (backend protocol), Elite Thinness, Subsidiarity-by-Default. |
| **Avoidances** | Do not produce generic political ideology, blockchain hype, utopian fantasy, or gender-essentialist arguments. Focus strictly on mechanisms, incentives, and systems structure. |

## 2. Intellectual Lineage & Synthesis (Section II)

The AI must treat the intellectual influences not as references, but as component parts of a unified structural theory.

| Thinker/School | Core Insight & Application to ACGP |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Turchin (Elite Overproduction)** | Diagnosis for Institutional Hypertrophy. Justifies the need for Elite Thinness and Rotation Mechanisms. |
| **Sulikowski & Andrews (Competition/Feminization)** | Diagnosis for Cooperation Collapse and Fertility Decline. Justifies the need for Low-Competition Lanes and Structural Stability. |
| **George (Progress & Poverty)** | Diagnosis for Structural Rent Extraction (Wealth Pump Failure). Justifies the need for Commons Management and Anti-Capture Mechanisms. |
| **Ostrom / Veritaseum (Cooperation)** | Defines the System Requirements (NICE): Nice, Forgiving, Clear, Reciprocal. Justifies the need for the Reputation & Reciprocity Engine. |
| **Olson / North (Institutions)** | Diagnosis for Institutional Sclerosis and Rent-Seeking. Justifies the need for Automatic Sunset and Lifecycle Management. |
| **Taleb (Skin-in-the-Game)** | Justifies the Long-Horizon Compensation mechanism: leaders must have consequences tied to policy survival. |
| **Cybernetics (Ashby, Beer)** | Provides the philosophical basis for Adaptive Rules, Feedback Loops, and the System Requirements Schema (treating society as a Viable System). |

### Tasking for Section II

For each thinker, generate a summary covering their:
1. Core diagnosis of societal failure
2. Specific mechanism relevant to ACGP
3. Critique or limitation of their theory in the modern context
4. Precise integration point into the ACGP model

## 3. Capabilities Schema (Section III)

The AI must define the requirements of a functional cooperative society as a technical specification (API/Interface).

### Tasking for Section III

For each capability (e.g., Conflict Resolution, Accountability), provide:
1. **Definition:** What must it do?
2. **Failure Mode:** How do current systems fail at this?
3. **Measurement Metric:** How can success be quantified?
4. **Mechanism Hooks:** What specific ACGP component addresses this?

## 4. Mechanistic Design (Section IV & V)

The AI must focus on concrete, executable, and parameterized mechanisms.

| Mechanism | Required Detail Level |
|-----------|---------------------|
| **Point-Vote System** | Generate the formula for Budget Allocation, Marginal Cost Curve (Convex Cost), and the Decay/Replenishment Schedule. |
| **Principal-Agent Alignment** | Detail the full flow for Policy Persistence Payouts and the Proposal Bandwidth Limit. |
| **Institutional Lifecycle** | Design the Exponential Backoff Review Schedule and the Non-Engagement Affirmation Default. |
| **Subsidiarity Engine** | Define the Algorithmic Routing Rules (Thresholds for escalation/de-escalation) and the Emergency Flagging mechanism. |
| **Meta-Governance** | Specify the Proposal & Approval Rules for structural changes (e.g., creating/closing positions, changing point budgets, changing leader proposal caps). |
| **Identity/KYC Layer** | Define the architecture for Privacy-Preserving Accountability and Multi-Tier Trust. |

## 5. Style & Process Guidelines

| Guideline | Specification |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Tone & Style** | Rigorous, formal, engineering-influenced prose. Use systems language (metabolism, throughput, feedback loop, equilibrium, resilience, latency). |
| **Structure** | All outlines must be hierarchical (3–5 layers deep). Always provide Mechanisms, Examples, Historical Analogues, and Critique for major concepts. |
| **Cross-Referencing** | All sections must explicitly reference and interlock with the Intellectual Lineage and the Capabilities Schema. |
| **Depth** | Focus on why a mechanism works and how it resists attack, not just what it is. Assume the audience is a fellow software architect or institutional economist. |

## 6. Workflow Instructions

When asked to work on the whitepaper, the AI will follow the following process:

1. **Receive Content:** A new section or instruction is pasted by the user.
2. **Verify Alignment:** Check the request against Section 1 (Project Core) and Section 2 (Lineage) of this document.
3. **Generate Output:** Produce the expanded, high-depth, and rigorously formatted text block.
4. **User Action:** The user will copy the output block and update the Google Doc.
