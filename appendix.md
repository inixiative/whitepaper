## Authors & Thinkers

### Andrews, Helen
Conservative cultural critic analyzing feminization of late-stage societies. Examines how institutions shift from mission-focus to coalition-maintenance as societies saturate. Complements Sulikowski's work on competitive saturation with cultural/institutional lens.

### Ashby, Ross
Cybernetician who formulated the Law of Requisite Variety: regulatory mechanisms must match system complexity. Foundation for understanding why one-size-fits-all governance fails and why subsidiarity is necessary.

### Beer, Stafford
Developed the Viable System Model (VSM) - cybernetic framework for organizational design. Any viable system requires five subsystems: Operations, Coordination, Control, Intelligence, and Policy. Requisite variety principle explains optimal complexity matching.

### Burke, James
Historian of technology and science. *Connections* and *The Day the Universe Changed* demonstrate path-dependency in technological development - early choices lock in trajectories for centuries.

### Cantillon, Richard
18th century economist who identified that new money doesn't affect everyone equally - those closest to money creation benefit first (Cantillon Effect). Explains wealth concentration from monetary expansion.

### George, Henry (1839-1897)
Political economist who analyzed how land monopolies capture economic gains. Proposed land value taxation to eliminate rent extraction. Framework applies to any scarce resource control - land, money creation, institutional positions.

### Graeber, David (1961-2020)
Anthropologist and anarchist theorist. Work spans debt anthropology, bureaucracy critique, and technological stagnation. Identified how bureaucracy shifted capitalism from innovation to social control. Proposed jubilee mechanisms as structural requirement for sustainable cooperation.

### Jiang, [First name needed]
Author of *Death by Meritocracy*. Analyzes how meritocratic competition creates elite bloat and institutional empire-building. Bureaucrats hire subordinates to increase status, creating ratchet effect where complexity only increases.

### North, Douglass (1920-2015)
Nobel Prize-winning institutional economist. Distinguished allocative efficiency (optimizing within existing rules) from adaptive efficiency (evolving better rules). Societies optimized for allocative efficiency often cannot handle adaptive challenges.

### Olson, Mancur (1932-1998)
Economist who analyzed institutional sclerosis. Stable societies accumulate interest groups and regulations until calcified into "institutional arteriosclerosis." Rules almost never sunset voluntarily; simplification requires collapse or war.

### Ostrom, Elinor (1933-2012)
Nobel Prize-winning political economist. Studied commons governance, identifying conditions for durable cooperation without privatization or central authority. Design principles for successful resource management at community scale.

### Ostrom, Vincent (1919-2012)
Political theorist who developed polycentric governance theory with Elinor. Multiple centers of decision-making at different scales create competitive and cooperative dynamics. Challenged assumption that effective coordination requires centralization.

### Posner, Eric
Legal scholar collaborating with Weyl on market mechanism design. *Radical Markets* proposes governance innovations enabled by digital infrastructure.

### Rothschild, Mayer Amschel (1744-1812)
Founder of Rothschild banking dynasty. Famous quote: "Let me issue and control a nation's money and I care not who writes the laws." Understood that control over scarce resources equals power regardless of formal political structures.

### Scott, James C.
Political scientist and anthropologist. *Seeing Like a State* critiques high-modernist central planning. Argues legibility demands destroy unmeasured value (metis, local knowledge, informal practices). Champion of subsidiarity and vernacular practices.

### Shellenberger, Michael
Environmental policy analyst. *Apocalypse Never* documents regulatory capture in energy sector, particularly suppression of 4th generation nuclear technology by oil and military-industrial interests.

### Srinivasan, Balaji
Entrepreneur and technologist. *The Network State* proposes voluntary, cloud-first political communities. Digital coordination enables governance pluralism and startup societies competing through demonstrated value rather than geographic monopoly.

### Sulikowski, Dani
Evolutionary psychologist studying intrasexual competition and fertility. Research shows competitive saturation in hierarchies suppresses both cooperation and reproduction. When populations swell, internal competition dominates and cooperation collapses.

### Tainter, Joseph
Anthropologist specializing in societal collapse. *The Collapse of Complex Societies* argues civilizations fail when marginal returns to complexity turn negative. Voluntary simplification is key distinction between civilizations that adapt and those that collapse.

### Taleb, Nassim Nicholas
Philosopher of uncertainty and risk. *Skin in the Game* argues for aligning incentives with consequences. Leaders must bear costs of their decisions over appropriate time horizons. Critique of hidden fragility and agency problems.

### Turchin, Peter
Quantitative historian developing "cliodynamics" - mathematical modeling of historical dynamics. Structural-demographic theory shows civilizations follow predictable cycles driven by elite overproduction and popular immiseration.

### Vinge, Vernor
Computer scientist and science fiction author. Insight that civilizational capability scales with log(available energy per capita). Energy is THE metric for measuring progress, explaining technological plateaus when energy sources stagnate.

### Weinstein, Eric
Mathematician and commentator. Quote: "We are now gods, but for the wisdom." Identifies wisdom as ability to match time horizons to problem types - the "marshmallow test" calibrated to context rather than infinite deferral.

### Weyl, Glen
Economist and social technologist. *Radical Markets* with Posner proposes mechanism designs (quadratic voting, Harberger taxes, data dignity) that were theoretically sound but practically impossible before digital infrastructure.

## Key Concepts & Theories

### Cantillon Effect
Monetary phenomenon where new money creation benefits those closest to the source first. By the time new money reaches ordinary workers, prices have already risen. Explains wealth concentration from monetary expansion post-1971.

### Elite Overproduction (Turchin)
When societies credential more people for elite positions than positions available. Creates frustrated aspirant class with skills to organize and motivation to challenge existing power. Drives intra-elite conflict and institutional sclerosis.

### Fourth Turning / Generational Cycle
~80-year cycle where societies forget war's horror and drift back toward conflict. Suggests war has evolutionary value at group selection level despite harming individuals.

### Fractional Reserve Banking
Practice of lending out deposits that don't fully exist. $100 deposit becomes $1,000 in circulating currency through recursive lending. Not intermediation but money creation - whoever controls this controls the economy.

### Goodhart's Law
"When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure." Metrics become gamed; people optimize for appearance over substance. Core problem in measurement-based governance.

### Hayflick Limit
Maximum number of times a cell can divide before senescence. Metaphor for term limits - arbitrary death regardless of health. Better approach: legitimacy-based tenure (remove failing leaders, keep effective ones).

### Institutional Arteriosclerosis (Olson)
Stable societies accumulate interest groups and regulations until calcified. Each rule individually reasonable, but rules never sunset. Result: impenetrable regulatory thicket strangling innovation and protecting incumbents.

### Marshmallow Test / Time Horizon Matching
Test of delayed gratification. Wisdom = calibrating delay to context, not infinite deferral. Governance must match time horizons to problem types: long-horizon compensation for infrastructure, rapid iteration for experiments.

### Metis (Scott)
Local, tacit, experiential knowledge that people accumulate through practice. Cannot be formalized or measured but essential for effective action. Centralized planning destroys metis by demanding legibility.

### Nash Equilibrium
State where no player can improve their outcome by unilaterally changing strategy. Often suboptimal (tragedy of commons, prisoner's dilemma). Governance design must shift equilibria toward cooperation.

### Requisite Variety (Ashby/Beer)
Regulatory mechanisms must match system complexity. Too simple = lose control. Too complex = waste resources. Implies subsidiarity (route problems to appropriate scale) and parsimony (minimum necessary complexity).

### Schelling Point
Focal point that people converge on in absence of communication. Governance mechanisms shift Schelling points: elections incentivize short-term thinking; continuous accountability incentivizes sustained approval.

### Skin in the Game (Taleb)
Aligning incentives with consequences. Decision-makers must bear costs of their choices over appropriate time horizons. Asymmetry between upside (captured by elites) and downside (borne by others) creates moral hazard.

### WTF Happened in 1971
Inflection point when Nixon closed gold window, ending dollar-gold convertibility. Charts show: wage-productivity decoupling, housing cost explosion, income inequality surge, savings collapse, debt surge. Fiat money printing removed hard constraints on elite/bureaucratic expansion.

## Case Studies

### 2008 Financial Crisis & Dodd-Frank
Should have been moment to clear institutional deadwood and break up concentrated financial power. Instead became masterclass in regulatory capture:
- Big banks got bigger (consolidation increased systemic risk)
- Dodd-Frank's 2,300+ pages created compliance costs only large institutions could afford
- Community banks decimated, new bank formation essentially stopped
- No major executives prosecuted despite widespread fraud
- Bank lobbyists literally drafted portions of legislation
- Moral hazard locked in: bailout precedent proved major institutions will be rescued regardless of behavior

### Flint Water Crisis
Example of high-modernist planning failure. Centralized decision to switch water source to save money, ignoring local knowledge and tacit information. Legibility demands (cost optimization) destroyed unmeasured value (water safety, trust, health).

### Soviet Collective Farms
Scott's paradigmatic example of legibility destroying metis. Central planners replaced vernacular farming knowledge with "scientific" monoculture. Destroyed peasant expertise, caused famines, demonstrated limits of central optimization.

### Brasília
Planned capital city beautiful on paper, dysfunctional in practice. Le Corbusier-inspired high-modernist design ignored how people actually live and move. Demonstrates cost of forcing reality to match abstract models.

### Tanzania Villagization (Ujamaa)
Forced resettlement program destroyed local social structures and agricultural practices. Another Scott example of legibility demands (making populations "readable" to state) destroying informal coordination that actually worked.

### Oak Ridge Molten Salt Reactor (1960s)
Successfully operated experimental thorium reactor demonstrating 4th generation nuclear technology. Despite proven feasibility, development was suppressed because:
- PWR design (from submarines) already had institutional infrastructure
- Alternative designs threatened military-industrial complex (couldn't easily make bombs)
- Alternative designs threatened oil/gas interests (too cheap and abundant)
Concrete example of Graeber's thesis: bureaucracy killed poetic technology

### Singapore's Development (Lee Kuan Yew, 1959-1990)
Lee governed for 31 years, transforming Singapore from third-world to first-world. Demonstrates value of merit-based tenure vs arbitrary term limits. Effective leaders should serve as long as they maintain legitimacy, not be forced out by Hayflick limit.

### Kodak, Blockbuster, Detroit Automakers
North's examples of allocative vs adaptive efficiency failure. Allocatively efficient within existing paradigm (film, rentals, internal combustion) but institutionally incapable of adapting to paradigm shifts (digital, streaming, electric vehicles). Success creates path dependence that resists adaptation.
