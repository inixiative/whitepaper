# Project Plan: Whitepaper to Prototype (Draft v1.0)

## Project Title

Project Inixiative: Adaptive Governance Infrastructure

## Project Goal

Produce a high-quality, technically rigorous, and deeply researched whitepaper that proposes a complete structural alternative to legacy governance models, transitioning from a conceptual outline to a minimum viable product (MVP) design.

## Deliverables

1. **Final Whitepaper Draft:** 40–80 pages, fully sourced, with all sections complete.
2. **Technical Appendix:** Pseudocode, architecture diagrams, and formal models.
3. **Pilot Plan:** A ready-to-implement strategy for a small, initial community experiment.

## Phase II: The Structural Foundation (Estimated: 4–6 Weeks)

| Milestone | Deliverables | Focus & AI Tasking |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| **M1: Intellectual Lineage** | Section 1 complete (10+ sub-sections). Annotated bibliography. | **Task:** Research and summarize the core argument, diagnosis, and relevance of each thinker (Turchin, Sulikowski, Andrews, George, Olson, Ostrom, Ast). |
| **M2: Diagnosis & Requirements** | Sections 2 & 3 complete (Diagnosis & System Requirements Schema). | **Task:** Formalize the definitions of Institutional Cancer, Elite Hypertrophy, and the 8 Cooperative Society Capabilities (Interface Spec). |
| **M3: Mechanism Deep Dive** | Section 4 complete (Inixiative/Instituxion definitions & core mechanisms). | **Task:** Expand the Principal-Agent Alignment section (long-horizon incentives), the Subsidiarity Engine, and the Institutional Lifecycle Engine with parameters/math. |
| **M4: Meta-Governance Spec** | All meta-governance controls defined (e.g., how to create/retire positions, adjust points). | **Task:** Design the full workflow for Meta-Governance Proposals (changing the system itself) with required thresholds. |

## Phase III: The Technical and Visual Layer (Estimated: 3–4 Weeks)

| Milestone | Deliverables | Focus & AI Tasking |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| **M5: Technical Architecture** | Section 5 complete (App Architecture, Data Model, Governance Modules). | **Task:** Design Flow Models (User Flow, Policy Lifecycle) and pseudocode for the Point Allocation System and Subsidiarity Routing Algorithm. |
| **M6: Visual & Formal Appendix** | Appendix complete (Diagrams, Formal Models, Glossary). | **Task:** Develop the Elite Thickness Function (a simple mathematical model of elite size and resource consumption) and the Cooperation Cost Curve (graph of cooperation cost vs. social scale). |
| **M7: Risk Analysis & Counter-Attack** | Section 7 complete (Risks, Limitations, Mitigation Strategies). | **Task:** Run an Adversarial Audit (AI to act as a system attacker) to stress-test the Principal-Agent and Point-Voting mechanisms. |

## Phase IV: Publication & Strategy (Estimated: 2–3 Weeks)

| Milestone | Deliverables | Focus & AI Tasking |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| **M8: Roadmap & Pilot Design** | Section 6 complete (Roadmap). Detailed Pilot Plan for a small community (e.g., university, co-op). | **Task:** Create a Minimal Viable Community (MVC) Specification and a staged implementation plan for the first 12 months. |
| **M9: Final Edit & Presentation** | Sections 0 & 8 complete (Abstract/Conclusion). Final polish. | **Task:** Polish the tone (e.g., academic vs. engineering) and produce versions tailored for different audiences (investors, academics, public). |

## Timeline Summary

- **Phase II:** 4–6 weeks (Structural Foundation)
- **Phase III:** 3–4 weeks (Technical & Visual Layer)
- **Phase IV:** 2–3 weeks (Publication & Strategy)
- **Total Estimated Time:** 9–13 weeks

## Success Criteria

- Whitepaper is academically rigorous with proper citations
- All mechanisms are clearly defined with parameters and examples
- Technical architecture is detailed enough for prototype development
- Risk analysis comprehensively addresses potential failure modes
- Document is polished and accessible to multiple audiences
