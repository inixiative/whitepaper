# Glossary

**Project Inixiative: Key Terms and Definitions**

This glossary provides definitions for technical terms, concepts, and mechanisms used throughout the whitepaper. Terms are organized alphabetically.

---

## A

**Adaptive Efficiency**
The capacity of a system to evolve and improve institutional structures over time, as opposed to allocative efficiency (optimal resource distribution within fixed rules). Concept from Douglass North emphasizing long-term institutional flexibility over short-term optimization.

**Anti-Capture Architecture**
Design principles that prevent special interests or elite factions from taking control of governance systems. Includes mechanisms like transparency requirements, turnover mandates, distributed authority, and automatic sunset provisions.

**Approval-Based Jurisdiction**
A governance model where authority over individuals requires their consent, rather than being imposed by geography or birth. Enables voluntary association and competitive governance systems.

---

## B

**Bureaucratic Cancer**
The pathological growth of administrative structures beyond functional necessity, creating self-perpetuating institutional bloat. Results in declining marginal returns to complexity (Tainter) and increased coordination costs.

---

## C

**Cellular Delegation**
A hierarchical representation system based on Dunbar-bounded groups (50-150 people). Citizens organize into "cells," each selecting one recallable representative. Representatives form higher-level "tissue layers" that recursively delegate upward, creating scalable democratic structures without losing local accountability.

**Cliodynamics**
The mathematical modeling of historical dynamics, particularly elite overproduction cycles and societal collapse patterns. Developed by Peter Turchin using demographic and economic data to predict instability.

**Commons Governance**
Management systems for shared resources (fisheries, forests, irrigation) that avoid both tragedy of the commons and privatization. Elinor Ostrom identified 8 principles for successful commons: clear boundaries, participatory decision-making, monitoring, graduated sanctions, conflict resolution, recognition of rights, nested enterprises, and polycentric governance.

**Competitive Saturation**
The state where status and resources become zero-sum due to overproduction of elite aspirants relative to available positions. Drives cooperation breakdown and increases defection incentives.

**Convex Voting Costs**
A voting mechanism where expressing stronger preferences costs progressively more (quadratic or exponential). Prevents extremism while capturing preference intensity. Used in quadratic voting and point-voting systems.

**Cooperation-as-a-Service**
Infrastructure that makes collective action cheap and scalable, similar to how cloud platforms make computing accessible. Project Inixiative's core value proposition.

---

## D

**DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)**
An organization governed by smart contracts and token-based voting rather than hierarchical management. Enables trustless coordination but often suffers from plutocracy and low participation.

**DAO-as-a-Service**
The instituxional tier of Project Inixiative, allowing existing organizations to deploy modular governance tools without rebuilding their entire structure. White-label governance infrastructure.

**Dunbar Number**
The cognitive limit of stable social relationships one person can maintain, approximately 150 people. Used as a design constraint for cellular delegation to preserve social cohesion and accountability.

---

## E

**Elite Hypertrophy**
The overproduction of elite aspirants (credentialed professionals competing for limited high-status positions) relative to elite positions available. Turchin's primary predictor of societal instability and institutional dysfunction.

**Energy-Backed Currency**
An experimental monetary system where units represent kilowatt-hours (kWh) of energy rather than fiat currency. Proposed as a stable medium of exchange independent of national monetary policy.

**Epistemic Fragmentation**
The breakdown of shared sense-making capacity across society. Caused by credentialism destroying generalist expertise, information overload, institutional illegibility, and the loss of cross-domain synthesis ability.

**Escrow & Conditional Release**
Smart contract mechanism that holds committed resources (money, time, expertise) until predetermined thresholds are met. Automatically refunds if conditions fail; releases to execution if successful. Core to inixiative funding model.

**Evolutionary Light Cone**
The time horizon and information available to a mechanism when making decisions. Determines what second-order effects and long-term consequences a system can "see" and respond to.

---

## F

**Flow Builder**
Visual governance workflow tool (analogous to Zapier/n8n for governance). Drag-and-drop interface for creating conditional logic, multi-stage decision processes, and resource allocation rules without coding.

---

## G

**Goodhart's Law**
"When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure." The phenomenon where optimizing for metrics causes gaming behavior that undermines the original intent. Major risk for reputation systems and performance tracking.

---

## H

**Harberger Tax**
A system where asset holders self-assess value, pay tax on that valuation, and must sell to anyone willing to pay the self-assessed price. Reduces monopoly rents and incentivizes honest valuation. Proposed by Glen Weyl for land, spectrum, and intellectual property.

---

## I

**Inixiative**
A time-bounded collective action where participants commit real resources (money, time, expertise) to achieve a specific goal. When thresholds are met, escrow releases and execution begins. Examples: install bike lanes, fund research, form worker co-ops, coordinate shareholders.

**Instituxion**
A persistent entity that spawns and manages multiple inixiatives over time. The "parent" organization with long-term goals and lifecycle management. Examples: neighborhood associations, companies using participatory budgeting, DAOs coordinating initiatives, universities managing research funding.

**Institutional Sclerosis**
Mancur Olson's concept: the gradual accumulation of special interest groups and regulatory complexity that ossifies institutions and prevents adaptation. Leads to declining productivity and innovation capacity.

---

## K

**KYC (Know Your Customer)**
Identity verification processes used to prevent fraud, Sybil attacks, and money laundering. Inixiative uses multi-tier verification: email → phone → government ID → vouched identity.

---

## L

**Land Value Tax (LVT)**
A tax on the unimproved value of land (location rent) rather than buildings or productive improvements. Proposed by Henry George to capture economic rent without distorting incentives. Successfully implemented in Singapore, Hong Kong, and Taiwan.

**Lifecycle Management**
Governance mechanisms that enforce automatic sunset, renewal conditions, and generational accountability for institutions. Prevents permanent bureaucracies and enables adaptive evolution.

---

## M

**Metacrisis**
Daniel Schmachtenberger's term for the convergent set of global risks (environmental collapse, arms races, institutional failure, epistemic breakdown) that share common root causes in rivalry dynamics and coordination failures.

**Metis**
James C. Scott's term for practical, local, experiential knowledge that cannot be fully captured in formal rules. Often destroyed by top-down rationalization schemes that fail to account for complexity.

---

## N

**Network State**
Balaji Srinivasan's framework: a highly aligned online community that crowdfunds territory, builds physical infrastructure, and eventually gains diplomatic recognition. Enables governance pluralism through voluntary association and easy exit. Examples: Próspera (Honduras), Cabin, Praxis.

---

## O

**Ostrom's 8 Principles**
Elinor Ostrom's empirically-derived rules for successful commons governance:
1. Clear boundaries
2. Participatory decision-making
3. Monitoring mechanisms
4. Graduated sanctions
5. Conflict resolution processes
6. Recognition of rights to organize
7. Nested enterprises (subsidiarity)
8. Polycentric governance

---

## P

**Point-Voting**
A voting mechanism where participants receive a fixed budget of points to allocate across multiple options, with convex costs (quadratic or exponential) for concentrating votes. Captures preference intensity without enabling tyranny of intense minorities.

**Polycentric Governance**
Systems with multiple overlapping centers of authority rather than a single hierarchy. Enables experimentation, competitive pressure, and subsidiarity. Advocated by Vincent Ostrom as superior to monocentric systems.

**Principal-Agent Problem**
The misalignment between the goals of principals (voters, shareholders) and their agents (politicians, executives). Agents often pursue their own interests rather than those they represent. Addressed through transparency, performance bonds, and recallability.

---

## Q

**Quadratic Voting**
A voting mechanism where the cost of votes increases quadratically (1 vote = 1 credit, 2 votes = 4 credits, 3 votes = 9 credits). Allows expression of preference intensity while preventing plutocracy. Proposed by Glen Weyl and Eric Posner.

---

## R

**Radical Markets**
Glen Weyl and Eric Posner's framework for market-based solutions to monopoly and preference aggregation problems. Includes Harberger taxes and quadratic voting.

**Regulatory Capture**
The process by which regulated industries gain control over their regulators, using them to create barriers to entry and extract rents rather than serve public interest.

**Rent-Seeking**
Extracting value through control of access or artificial scarcity rather than productive activity. Examples: land speculation, credential gatekeeping, regulatory capture, monopoly pricing.

**Reputation with Safeguards**
Reputation systems designed to avoid permanent underclass formation. Includes bankruptcy mechanisms, decay over time, context isolation (reputation doesn't transfer across all domains), and opt-out provisions.

---

## S

**Schelling Point**
A focal point that people converge on in the absence of communication, or an equilibrium that becomes self-reinforcing once established. Governance design shifts Schelling points to favor cooperation over defection.

**Selectorate**
The group whose support is necessary to maintain power. Bruce Bueno de Mesquita's concept: small selectorates (dictatorships, oligarchies) incentivize corruption and rent extraction; large selectorates (democracies) incentivize public goods provision.

**Sybil Attack**
A security threat where one entity creates multiple fake identities to gain disproportionate influence in voting, reputation, or resource allocation systems. Mitigated through identity verification (KYC) and stake-based mechanisms.

**Smart Contract**
Self-executing code on a blockchain that enforces agreements without trusted intermediaries. Enables trustless coordination, transparent execution, and programmable incentives at scales previously impossible.

**Subsidiarity**
The principle that decisions should be made at the lowest competent level. Problems handled locally unless they genuinely require higher-level coordination. Prevents inappropriate escalation and preserves metis.

---

## T

**Tragedy of the Commons**
Garrett Hardin's concept: shared resources get depleted because individuals capture full benefit of exploitation but share costs of degradation. Ostrom showed this is not inevitable—properly designed governance can sustain commons.

**Trustless Execution**
Systems where agreements are enforced by code and cryptography rather than requiring trust in human intermediaries. Smart contracts enable trustless execution of complex conditional logic.

---

## U

**Universe 25**
John B. Calhoun's mouse experiment showing behavioral collapse despite material abundance. When competition shifted from survival to status (mate access), cooperation broke down, fertility crashed, and populations collapsed. Analogous to elite overproduction in humans.

---

## V

**Voluntary Association**
Governance systems where participation is opt-in rather than imposed by geography or birth. Enables competitive pressure, easy exit, and preference matching. Core principle of network states and approval-based jurisdiction.

---

## W

**Wealth Pump**
A system that concentrates resources upward regardless of productive contribution. Examples: rent extraction from land, credentialism creating artificial scarcity, regulatory capture enabling monopoly pricing.

---

## Z

**Zero-Sum Competition**
Situations where one party's gain requires another's loss. Contrasts with positive-sum cooperation where all parties can benefit. Competitive saturation transforms previously positive-sum domains (innovation, education) into zero-sum status games.
