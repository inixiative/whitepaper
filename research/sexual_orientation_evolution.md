# Research Report: Sexual Orientation as Concentric Selection on Patterns
## An Application of the Multiscale Competency Framework (Section 3.1)

**Date:** February 2026
**Purpose:** Examine the evolutionary persistence of homosexuality through the lens of concentric selection — selection operating on patterns at every scale — as developed in the whitepaper's multiscale competency framework
**Connection:** Section 3.1 (Multiscale Competency), Postscript on Observation and the Nature of Coordination (Document 2)

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Homosexuality presents what the literature calls the "Darwinian Paradox": a trait with a heritable component that reduces direct reproductive output, yet persists at stable rates (2-10%) across cultures and across 1,500+ documented species. Gene-level analysis cannot explain this. The paradox dissolves under concentric selection — the recognition that selection operates on patterns at every scale, not just genes.

**Core argument:** Homosexuality is inexplicable at the gene-pattern level but predictable at the group-pattern level. It correlates with sociality across species, increases with family size via a biological regulatory mechanism, and serves coordination functions (alliance formation, conflict reduction, alloparenting) that strengthen the group pattern. This makes it a strong empirical case for the whitepaper's central claim: that Dawkins' gene-level analysis is not wrong but incomplete — one ring of a concentric set.

**Key empirical findings:**

1. **Sociality correlation confirmed.** Same-sex behavior is significantly more common in social species than solitary ones, across mammals broadly (Monk et al. 2019) and primates specifically (2026 *Nature Ecology & Evolution*). Social complexity directly promotes its occurrence.

2. **Fraternal birth order effect.** Each older biological brother increases a male's probability of homosexuality by ~33% (Blanchard & Bogaert, replicated across >10,000 subjects). Mechanism identified: maternal immune sensitization to male-specific NLGN4Y protein (Bogaert et al. 2018, *PNAS*).

3. **Polygenic architecture.** The largest GWAS (Ganna et al. 2019, *Science*, n=477,522) found five significant loci, with common SNPs explaining 8-25% of variance. No "gay gene" — many small-effect variants, consistent with a trait under balancing selection rather than directional selection against it.

4. **Sexually antagonistic selection.** Female relatives of homosexual men show higher fecundity — the same genetic variants that contribute to male homosexuality appear to confer reproductive advantages in females. The alleles persist because they're beneficial at the family-pattern level even when costly to individual male carriers.

5. **Kin selection operates in context.** Samoan fa'afafine show elevated, kin-specific altruism toward nieces and nephews (Vasey & VanderLaan, multiple studies 2007-2014). Effect disappears in atomized Western cultures — suggesting the trait's group-level function requires the group-level pattern (communitarian social structure) to express.

## THE FRAMEWORK: CONCENTRIC SELECTION ON PATTERNS

### The Postscript's Hierarchy

The whitepaper's Postscript (Document 2) proposes a progression:

> 1. **Reality** selects for stability. Physics and chemistry produce persistent structures. No replication, just configurations that endure.
> 2. **Life** adds replication with variation. Selection operates across generations.
> 3. **Intelligence** adds goal-directed behavior.
> 4. **Consciousness** adds goal-conflict arbitration.
> 5. **Self-consciousness** adds modeling the integrator.

The key insight: at every level, what persists is a **pattern** — "not permanent objects but temporarily persisting, self-reinforcing dynamic patterns" (Section 3.1). Selection doesn't operate exclusively on genes, or organisms, or groups. It operates on patterns wherever they form and persist. Genes are patterns. Organisms are patterns. Families are patterns. Social groups are patterns. Species-typical behavioral repertoires are patterns.

### Concentric Selection, Not Refutation

This doesn't refute Dawkins. Genes are real units of selection. But they are one ring of a concentric set:

- **Gene-level patterns:** Alleles replicate. Selection favors alleles that increase their own frequency. At this level, homosexuality looks paradoxical — reduced reproduction should select it out.
- **Family-level patterns:** Families are patterns that persist across generations. Selection favors family configurations that produce more surviving descendants. At this level, sexually antagonistic selection makes sense — alleles that increase female fecundity persist even when they reduce some males' direct reproduction.
- **Group-level patterns:** Social groups are patterns that compete with other groups. Selection favors group configurations that coordinate better, fight less internally, allocate resources more efficiently. At this level, homosexuality looks like architecture — reducing male-male reproductive competition, providing alloparental care, strengthening alliances.
- **Species-level patterns:** Behavioral repertoires that characterize a species are patterns. Social species that include same-sex behavior in their repertoire show better conflict resolution and social cohesion. The pattern persists because species with it outcompete or outlast those without.

Each ring of the concentric set is real. Each faces its own selection pressure. The "paradox" only exists if you insist on analyzing from a single ring.

### The Monogamy Parallel

Section 3.1 makes this argument explicitly with monogamy (line 316):

> "For high-status males, polygyny might maximize individual reproductive success — more mates, more offspring. But societies that enforced monogamy outcompeted those that didn't. Why? Monogamy gives every man a reproductive stake in the system."

Homosexuality follows the same structural logic. At the individual gene level, it appears costly. At the group level, it solves a coordination problem — specifically, the problem of surplus male reproductive competition destabilizing the group. The trait that looks "maladaptive" from one ring is solving a multipolar trap at a wider ring.

The parallel extends further: monogamy is cultural architecture, homosexuality appears to be biological architecture solving a similar problem through a different mechanism. Both reduce the number of males in zero-sum reproductive competition, freeing energy for cooperative investment.

## EVIDENCE BY TOPIC

### 1. The Fraternal Birth Order Effect: A Biological Governance Mechanism

**The finding:** Each older biological brother increases a male's probability of homosexuality by approximately 33%. This is one of the most replicated findings in the biology of sexual orientation.

**Key studies:**
- Blanchard & Bogaert (1996) — Original identification of the effect
- Blanchard (2018) meta-analysis — Confirmed across >10,000 subjects in independent populations
- Bogaert (2006) — Demonstrated the effect is biological, not social: raised with non-biological older brothers produces no effect; biological older brothers raised apart still produce the effect

**Magnitude:** Meta-analysis of 30 samples (Blanchard 2018) found a pooled Older Brothers Odds Ratio of **1.47** (p < .00001), significant in 20 of 30 instances. Population attributable fraction: 15-29% of homosexual men owe their orientation to this effect (Cantor et al. 2002; Blanchard 2018).

**Concrete probability estimates** (assuming 2% base rate for males with no older brothers):
- 0 older brothers: ~2.0%
- 1 older brother: ~2.6%
- 2 older brothers: ~3.5%
- 3 older brothers: ~4.6%
- 4 older brothers: ~6.0%

**The mechanism — Maternal immune hypothesis:**
- Bogaert et al. (2018), *PNAS*: Identified NLGN4Y (Neuroligin-4 Y-linked) as the likely antigen
- NLGN4Y is a male-specific cell-adhesion protein involved in synaptic functioning and male fetal brain development
- Progressive maternal immunization: mothers develop antibodies to NLGN4Y with each male pregnancy
- Antibody levels increase monotonically: women with no sons < mothers of heterosexual sons < mothers of gay sons with no older brothers < mothers of gay sons with older brothers
- Antibodies cross the placental barrier and alter sexual differentiation of the male fetal brain

**Confounds ruled out:**
- Not due to being raised with older brothers (adoption studies — Bogaert 2006)
- Not due to maternal or paternal age
- Not due to birth interval
- Not present in females (no type of sibling reliably relates to women's sexual orientation)
- **Handedness interaction** (Blanchard et al. 2006): The FBOE operates only in right-handed males — since handedness develops prenatally, this further confirms a prenatal biological mechanism (sample: 3,146 men)

**Caveats:**
- Vilsmeier et al. (2023) raised concerns about potential statistical artifacts, arguing the specific association between older brothers and homosexuality is "small, heterogeneous in magnitude, and apparently not specific to men"
- The Bogaert et al. (2018) NLGN4Y study did not find a significant difference between mothers of gay sons *with* older brothers vs. *without*, which complicates the progressive immunization narrative specifically

**Framework interpretation:** The FBOE looks like a **density-dependent biological governance mechanism** — a family-level pattern that regulates reproductive competition as male density increases. This is directly analogous to the "density sensor" discussed in Section 3.1: carrying capacity triggers behavioral shifts. The mother's immune system functions as a sensor that reads male offspring count and adjusts the developmental trajectory of subsequent sons. This isn't pathology — it's regulation at the family-pattern level.

### 2. Cross-Species Distribution: The Sociality Correlation

**The finding:** Same-sex sexual behavior (SSB) has been documented in over 1,500 species. Among mammals, 261 of 5,747 species (~4.5%) show SSB, representing roughly half of all mammal families. In primates, 59 of 491 species show documented SSB.

**The critical finding — correlation with sociality:**

**Monk et al. (2019), *Nature Ecology & Evolution*:**
- Comprehensive phylogenetic analysis across mammals
- SSB is significantly more common in social species than solitary ones
- Male SSB frequency correlates with frequency of intra-male lethal aggression — supporting the hypothesis that SSB evolved to mitigate male-male conflict
- SSB evolved independently many times across mammalian families
- Became more frequent in Old World monkeys; increased again during great ape evolution

**Clemente et al. (2026), *Nature Ecology & Evolution*:**
- Phylogenetic regression and structural equation modeling across the primate clade
- Environmental and life-history traits influence SSB indirectly
- **Social complexity directly promotes SSB occurrence**
- SSB more likely in species with: drier climates (resource stress), longer lifespans, significant sexual dimorphism, more complex/stratified social structure
- Predator pressure also a predictor

**Underreporting bias:** Expert survey (PLOS ONE, 2024) found massive underreporting: **76.7%** of mammal researchers had observed SSB in their study species, but only **48.2%** collected data on it, and only **18.5%** published on it. The true prevalence of SSB across mammals is almost certainly far higher than documented.

**Rhesus macaque evidence — Clive et al. (2023), *Nature Ecology & Evolution*:**
- 72% of male rhesus macaques engaged in same-sex mounting (vs. 46% attempting to mount females)
- SSB was **6.4% heritable** (from pedigree analysis dating to 1938) and 19.35% repeatable — the first evidence of a genetic link to primate SSB outside humans
- Males engaging in SSB formed **more coalitionary partnerships**, previously linked to improved reproductive success
- **No fitness cost** to SSB — if anything, SSB-performing males did better reproductively
- Positive genetic correlation between same-sex mounter and mountee activities, indicating a common genetic basis

**Framework interpretation:** This is the strongest evidence for concentric selection. If homosexuality were purely a gene-level accident — a mutation that keeps occurring but is selected against — we would expect:
- Random distribution across social and nonsocial species
- No correlation with sociality
- No phylogenetic pattern

Instead we find the opposite: SSB tracks sociality, evolved independently many times (convergent evolution), and increases with social complexity. This is the signature of a pattern that is **selected for** at the group level — precisely because social species face coordination problems (male aggression, alliance formation, conflict resolution) that SSB helps solve.

The prediction from the whitepaper framework: **we should see more SSB in species where group-level selection pressure is strongest.** That's exactly what we find.

### 3. Genetic Architecture: Polygenic, Not Purged

**Key study — Ganna et al. (2019), *Science*:**
- Largest GWAS on sexual behavior: 477,522 participants (US, UK, Sweden)
- Five loci reached genome-wide significance; three replicated in independent samples
- Common SNPs explain 8-25% of variance in same-sex sexual behavior
- Trait is highly polygenic — many small-effect variants, no single "gay gene"
- Genetic effects partially overlap but are not identical between males and females
- One significant SNP (rs28371400) linked to sex-hormone regulation (TCF12)
- Another (rs34730029) linked to olfactory genes — interesting given olfaction-reproduction links

**What the architecture tells us:**
- **Polygenic = under balancing selection.** Traits under strong directional selection (i.e., being selected out) lose genetic variation — alleles that harm fitness get purged. The substantial, widely distributed genetic variation underlying SSB is inconsistent with it being "selected against." Something is maintaining these alleles.
- **Partially sex-differentiated effects.** The genetic variants have different effects in males vs. females, consistent with sexually antagonistic selection — the same alleles may increase reproductive success in one sex while contributing to same-sex attraction in the other.

**Sexually antagonistic selection evidence:**
- Camperio-Ciani et al. (2004): Female maternal relatives of homosexual men have significantly higher fecundity than female maternal relatives of heterosexual men
- Zietsch et al. (2008): Heterosexual carriers of SSB-associated alleles show mating advantages — more sexual partners
- Gavrilets & Rice (2006): Mathematical models show sexually antagonistic selection can maintain homosexuality alleles in a population indefinitely

**Framework interpretation:** The genetic architecture is exactly what concentric selection predicts. At the gene level, these are alleles with mixed effects — costly in some carriers, beneficial in others. At the family level, they persist because net family fitness is maintained or enhanced (higher female fecundity offsets lower male reproduction). At the group level, the behavioral phenotype they produce serves coordination functions. No single level of analysis explains the persistence — you need the concentric set.

### 4. Kin Selection: The Fa'afafine Evidence

**The hypothesis:** Homosexual individuals offset their reduced direct reproduction by enhancing the reproductive success of genetic relatives (Hamilton 1964; Wilson 1975).

**The Samoan studies — Vasey & VanderLaan (2007-2014):**

Samoa provides a natural test case. Fa'afafine — biological males attracted to men — are a recognized, accepted gender category in Samoan culture. Samoa's communitarian, extended-family structure preserves the ecological conditions under which kin selection could operate.

**Findings:**
- Fa'afafine show significantly elevated avuncular (uncle-like) tendencies toward nieces and nephews compared to both Samoan women and heterosexual men (Vasey & VanderLaan 2009)
- This manifests behaviorally: increased money allocation to youngest sibling's children, more babysitting, tutoring, financial support for education and medical care (Vasey & VanderLaan 2010)
- Critically, fa'afafine altruism is **kin-specific, not generalized** — they show weaker links between avuncular behavior and general altruism toward children, suggesting targeted resource allocation to maximize inclusive fitness (Vasey & VanderLaan 2010, *Psychological Science*)
- Fa'afafine show cognitive biases toward investing in adaptive kin categories (young, female kin — who provide more reliable indirect fitness returns) compared to controls (VanderLaan & Vasey 2014)
- Cross-cultural replication: similar avuncular patterns found in Indonesian androphilic males and Mexican Istmo Zapotec *muxes*

**The Western failure to replicate:**
- No elevated avuncular behavior found in gay men in Canada, France, Italy, Japan, Spain, UK, or US
- Vasey's explanation: Western societies are individualistic, geographically dispersed, and historically homophobic — the ecological conditions for kin selection expression are absent

**The "super uncle" problem:**
- To fully offset zero reproduction, each fa'afafine would need to support ~2 additional surviving nieces/nephews who wouldn't otherwise exist
- Vasey himself concludes avuncularity "probably contributes to the evolutionary survival of genes for male same-sex attraction, but is unlikely to entirely offset the costs of not reproducing"

**Framework interpretation:** The Western replication failure is itself evidence for the framework. Kin selection for homosexuality requires the **group-level pattern** (communitarian, extended-family social structure) to express. Destroy the group pattern — atomize society into nuclear families, disperse kin geographically, stigmatize the trait — and the group-level function disappears, even though the trait persists. The trait evolved under ancestral conditions that resemble Samoa more than Manhattan.

This maps directly onto Section 3.1's developmental calibration argument (line 486): the cooperation radius is calibrated by the signal environment. In a communitarian culture, the fa'afafine's cooperation radius extends to the extended family, and avuncular investment follows. In an individualist culture, the same trait exists but the cooperation infrastructure that would channel it toward kin is absent.

### 5. Group-Level Functions: Social Bonding, Alliance Formation, Conflict Reduction

**Prosociality hypothesis — Barron & Hare (2020), *Frontiers in Psychology*:**
- Proposes that same-sex sexual attraction evolved alongside human self-domestication and selection for prosociality
- Humans, bonobos, and dogs all underwent selection for reduced reactive aggression and increased social tolerance — and all three show elevated SSB compared to close wild relatives
- Neurochemical overlap: serotonin, oxytocin, and androgen systems involved in both prosociality and SSB
- SSB is part of a "suite of traits" that evolved under selection for ease of social integration

**Bonobos as test case:**
- Bonobos show dramatically higher SSB than chimpanzees in contexts of social affiliation and play
- Female bonobos use genito-genital rubbing to reinforce social bonds and reduce tension after conflicts — creating a "second sisterhood" as counterstrategy against male coercion
- Both species share >98% DNA; the behavioral difference is in social architecture, not genetics

**Alliance formation:**
- In rhesus macaque populations, males engage in sexual relations with each other to form coalitions, which provide access to more females and higher reproductive success (observed in Puerto Rico populations)
- Same-sex interactions in primates serve functions including: appeasement, pacification, reinforcement of social dominance structures, juvenile play, social tolerance, stress reduction, and barter

**The mammalian pattern:**
- Comprehensive phylogenetic analysis (Monk et al. 2019): species with SSB tend to be more social and tolerant, with SSB correlating with group living and post-conflict reconciliation
- Male SSB frequency correlates specifically with lethal intra-male aggression rates — supporting the conflict-reduction function

**Alloparenting:**
- In group-living primates, nonreproductive individuals allow more efficient division of labor
- Homosexual individuals can focus on resource acquisition, childcare, and defense — contributing to group resilience
- This is the "helper" function, broader than kin-specific investment

**Framework interpretation:** These functions map directly onto Section 3.1's analysis of what social species need to coordinate:

1. **Reduced male-male competition** → The monogamy parallel. Both monogamy (cultural) and homosexuality (biological) reduce the number of males in zero-sum reproductive competition.
2. **Alliance formation** → Extending the cooperation radius. SSB creates bonds between non-kin males, expanding the group's coherence distance (Section 3.1, line 165).
3. **Conflict resolution** → Signal repair. Post-conflict SSB in bonobos and macaques functions as a reconciliation signal — restoring cooperative equilibrium after disruption.
4. **Alloparenting** → Surplus cooperative capacity. Non-reproductive individuals represent a "cooperative reserve" the group can deploy toward collective functions.

---

### 6. The Prediction: Sociality Requires It, Non-Sociality Doesn't

If homosexuality is a group-level coordination mechanism — part of the social species "toolkit" — the framework generates a clear prediction:

**More SSB in more social species. Less (or none) in solitary species.**

This prediction is confirmed:
- Monk et al. (2019): SSB significantly more common in social mammals
- Clemente et al. (2026): Social complexity *directly promotes* SSB in primates
- SSB tracks specifically with social variables (group size, hierarchical complexity, alliance structure), not just with phylogeny

The prediction can be sharpened: SSB should track not just with *sociality* but with the *specific coordination problems* that social living creates:
- More male SSB where male-male competition is lethal → confirmed (Monk et al. 2019)
- More female SSB where female alliance formation is critical → confirmed (bonobos vs. chimpanzees)
- More SSB overall in species with longer lifespans and repeated social interactions → confirmed (Clemente et al. 2026)

## SYNTHESIS: THE CONCENTRIC VIEW

### Why Gene-Level Analysis Fails

At the gene level, homosexuality is a paradox. Alleles that reduce reproduction should be purged. The standard escape routes are:

1. **Mutation-selection balance** — it keeps appearing by mutation faster than selection removes it. But the prevalence (2-10%) is far too high for this, and the trait is too phylogenetically structured.
2. **Kin selection alone** — it pays for itself through helping relatives. But the "super uncle" math doesn't close, and it doesn't explain the cross-species sociality correlation.
3. **Sexually antagonistic selection alone** — it pays for itself through female fecundity. Plausible but doesn't explain the sociality correlation either — why would female fecundity benefits be greater in social species?

Each partial explanation fails because it stays within one ring.

### The Concentric Resolution

View the same data through concentric selection:

**Gene-pattern level:** The alleles exist in a cloud of polygenic variants with mixed effects across sexes. They are maintained partly by sexually antagonistic selection (family-level benefit) and partly because they're not under strong directional selection against (group-level benefit prevents purging).

**Family-pattern level:** Families with these alleles show higher female fecundity. The FBOE acts as a density-dependent regulator — increasing probability of homosexuality as male offspring accumulate, managing within-family reproductive competition. The family pattern is optimized, not the individual.

**Group-pattern level:** Groups containing homosexual individuals show reduced male-male lethal aggression, stronger alliance networks, more alloparental care, better post-conflict reconciliation. The group pattern outcompetes groups without these coordination benefits.

**Species-pattern level:** Social species converge on SSB repeatedly and independently because sociality creates the coordination problems SSB helps solve. Solitary species don't face these problems and don't converge on the trait.

No single level explains the data. All levels together explain it parsimoniously.

### The FBOE as Biological Governance

The fraternal birth order effect deserves special attention because it's the most mechanistically understood component, and it maps precisely onto the whitepaper's governance framework:

- The mother's immune system functions as a **sensor** reading a family-level variable (male offspring count)
- The NLGN4Y antibody response functions as a **signal** — biological information that adjusts developmental trajectory
- The effect (increased probability of homosexuality in later-born sons) functions as **governance** — regulating within-family male competition as density increases
- The mechanism is **progressive** — not binary, but graduated, with probability increasing per older brother

This is bioelectricity as governance, operating at the family scale rather than the cellular scale. Section 3.1's framework predicts exactly this kind of mechanism: wherever there is coordination across scales, there must be a signaling substrate. The mother's immune system is that substrate for family-level reproductive coordination.

### What This Is Not

This analysis is not:

- **A claim that homosexuality is "for" the group** — teleological language obscures mechanism. The claim is that group-level selection pressure maintains alleles that would otherwise be selected out at the individual level.
- **A refutation of Dawkins** — Genes are real units of selection. The claim is that they are not the *only* units. Concentric selection includes gene-level selection as one ring.
- **A claim that homosexuality requires evolutionary "justification"** — The trait exists. The question is why it persists at the rates it does. The answer illuminates how selection works at multiple scales — it says nothing about the moral status of the trait.
- **A complete explanation** — Multiple mechanisms likely contribute simultaneously. The concentric framework organizes rather than replaces the specific hypotheses.

## CONNECTIONS TO THE WHITEPAPER

### Section 3.1: Selection Operates at Every Level (Line 312)

> "Competency exists at every scale — and so does selection. Cells face selection pressure. Individuals face selection pressure. Groups, institutions, and civilizations face selection pressure. What's optimal at one level may conflict with what's optimal at another."

Homosexuality is perhaps the cleanest example of this principle in biology. Optimal at one level (group coordination) conflicts with optimal at another (individual gene propagation). The trait persists because the wider ring of selection maintains what the narrower ring would purge.

### Section 3.1: The Monogamy Parallel (Line 316)

> "Societies that enforced monogamy outcompeted those that didn't... Monogamy channels surplus toward productive capital rather than reproductive competition."

Homosexuality achieves a structurally similar outcome through biological rather than cultural architecture. Both reduce the intensity of male reproductive competition, freeing energy for cooperative investment.

### Section 3.1: Chesterton's Fence (Line 322)

> "We've been optimizing for individual preference and freedom without understanding what group-level functions those 'constraining' structures were serving."

The historical stigmatization of homosexuality misapplied Chesterton's Fence — treating the trait as a defect rather than recognizing its group-level coordination function. But the inverse error is also possible: failing to understand *why* the trait exists at the rates it does (neither universal nor absent) misses the regulatory logic. The FBOE suggests the rate is itself regulated — not random, not fixed, but responsive to family-level conditions.

### Postscript: Everything Is Patterns (Line 2582)

> "Reality selects for stability. Physics and chemistry produce persistent structures."

The deepest connection. If selection operates on patterns at every scale — if a gene is a pattern, an organism is a pattern, a family is a pattern, a social group is a pattern — then the "Darwinian Paradox" was never a paradox. It was a category error: analyzing a multi-ring phenomenon from a single ring.

Life itself is "a temporarily persisting, self-reinforcing dynamic pattern." Homosexuality persists because the *patterns* that include it — families with regulated male competition, social groups with alliance networks and conflict resolution, species with coordination toolkits — are more stable, more self-reinforcing, more persistent than patterns without it.

Selection on patterns. All the way down.
