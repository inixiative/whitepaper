# Section 3 Evaluation Criteria
## Design Frameworks & Methodologies

### 1. **Abstraction Level**
- Is it presenting **conceptual frameworks** or **specific solutions**?
- Does it teach "how to think" rather than "what to do"?
- Are examples used sparingly to illustrate concepts, not diagnose problems?

### 2. **Tone Consistency**
- Does it match across subsections (3.1, 3.2, 3.3)?
- Is it philosophical/explanatory rather than prescriptive/normative?
- Does it avoid "we should" language?

### 3. **Clarity of Core Concept**
- Does each subsection have one clear central idea?
- Can you state the core concept in one sentence?
- Does everything in the subsection support that concept?

### 4. **Avoiding Diagnosis**
- Is it repeating Section 2's work (diagnosing current failures)?
- Or is it providing frameworks to understand a class of problems?
- Does it reference current failures as examples, or dwell on them?

### 5. **Self-Containment**
- Can each subsection stand alone as a thinking tool?
- Does it avoid forward references to solutions in Sections 4-6?
- Does it define its key terms clearly?

### 6. **Conceptual Density**
- Is there too much or too little?
- Does each paragraph add a new layer to the framework?
- Are there redundant restatements?

### 7. **Accessibility**
- Can a reasonably smart reader grasp the concept?
- Is the abstraction clear enough to be useful?
- Or is it so abstract it becomes meaningless?

### 8. **Key Concept Introduction**
- Are important named concepts (Goodhart's Law, Principal-Agent, etc.) introduced clearly?
- Do they get proper emphasis (bold, headers, etc.)?
- Are they integrated into the broader framework?

### 9. **Meta-Level Appropriateness**
- Is this truly a "design philosophy" or has it drifted into methodology/implementation?
- Does it address **why** we think about problems this way, not **how** to solve them?

### 10. **Bridge to Section 4**
- Does it set up Section 4 (requirements) without prescribing them?
- Does it create the mental models needed to understand why those requirements matter?
