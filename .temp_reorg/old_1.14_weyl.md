### 1.14 Glen Weyl & Eric Posner — Radical Markets

Glen Weyl and Eric Posner's *Radical Markets* proposes mechanisms that were theoretically sound but practically impossible before digital infrastructure. Their work demonstrates how technology can unlock governance models that address long-standing institutional pathologies—monopoly capture, preference aggregation failures, data extraction.

**Quadratic voting:** Standard voting treats all preferences as equal intensity. A voter mildly preferring Option A has the same power as one whose life depends on it. This creates two problems: minorities with intense preferences get steamrolled by indifferent majorities, and strategic voting (misrepresenting preferences) becomes optimal.

Weyl and Posner's solution: **voters buy votes, but the cost is quadratic.** One vote costs 1 credit. Two votes cost 4 credits. Ten votes cost 100 credits. This makes vote buying expensive (you can't simply purchase outcomes if you're wealthy) while enabling preference intensity to be expressed (if you care deeply, you can allocate more of your budget to that issue).

**The mechanism's elegance:**
- **Intense minorities can protect themselves** - Even if outnumbered, they can allocate budget to issues that matter to them
- **Wealthy interests can't simply buy outcomes** - The quadratic cost means buying dominance requires exponentially more resources
- **Reveals true preferences** - Strategic voting becomes harder; honest allocation is often optimal
- **Budget-constrained** - Everyone gets the same number of credits per period, preventing plutocracy

**Harberger taxes on monopoly positions:** In standard markets, monopolists (including monopolists on their own labor/expertise) extract rents by threatening to withhold. Weyl and Posner propose continuous auctions: you set a price on your position, pay taxes based on that valuation, and must sell if someone meets your price. This prevents rent extraction—you can't claim impossibly high value without paying correspondingly high taxes.

Applied to leadership roles: a position holder sets their "buy out" price, pays ongoing taxes on that valuation, and must step down if someone matches it. This creates turnover (preventing permanent entrenchment) while ensuring competent holders can remain if they provide enough value that no one wants to replace them.

**Data dignity:** Individuals should own and control their data, with ability to port it between platforms. This breaks platform lock-in and creates competition on service quality rather than captive user bases.

**Why these mechanisms were previously impossible:** Quadratic voting requires continuous, low-friction voting; budget tracking across issues; Sybil resistance to prevent fake identities from multiplying budgets; and tamper-proof results with transparent counting without trusted intermediaries. Smart contracts and digital identity enable all of this. What was theoretical in 2018 is now implementable.

**While developed independently, alignment with Weyl and Posner's mechanisms suggests these patterns are robust.** Their work demonstrates that **the constraint on better governance is often not political will but technical feasibility.** Now that the technical barriers have fallen, we can experiment with mechanisms that were previously pure theory.
