### 1.9 James C. Scott — Seeing Like a State

James C. Scott's *Seeing Like a State* dissects why high-modernist schemes—grand centralized plans to reorganize society—consistently fail. His answer: they ignore **metis**, the local, tacit, experiential knowledge that people accumulate through practice. Centralized planners demand legibility: everything must be measurable, categorizable, standardized. But reality is messier than models. Vernacular practices that work—traditional farming techniques, informal property arrangements, social trust networks—can't always be formalized or explained. When planners force legibility, they destroy what they can't measure.

**Examples of high-modernist failure:**
- Soviet collective farms: destroyed peasant knowledge, caused famines
- Brasília: planned capital city, beautiful on paper, dysfunctional in practice
- Tanzanian villagization: forced resettlement destroyed local social structures
- Scientific forestry: monoculture plantations optimized for timber yield, collapsed ecosystems

Each case followed the same pattern: measure what's convenient, optimize the metric, destroy unmeasured value.

**The tyranny of metrics:** Scott identifies how measurement becomes control. When authorities demand quantification, people game the system. Metrics become targets (Goodhart's Law). What can't be measured gets ignored—wisdom, judgment, social bonds, tacit knowledge. The result is systems optimized for legibility rather than function.

This connects directly to Section 2.7.7 (The Measurement Trap) and the repeated failures of social credit systems, prediction markets, and e-democracy platforms. **Whoever controls the rubric controls the population.** Defining what counts as "good" becomes a tool of power. Second-order effects compound: people become risk-averse, refuse to admit errors, optimize for appearance over substance. Scott's diagnosis shows why governance systems must preserve space for illegible, informal coordination—keeping decisions at the level where tacit local knowledge exists rather than forcing everything through legibility filters at inappropriate scales.

## THEME 3: What Works Instead (COOPERATION mechanisms)

The previous themes documented failure modes: structural crisis, economic parasitism, and forced legibility. Now we shift to what actually works. The Ostroms demonstrate that durable cooperation is possible at scale, but only through specific structural conditions and polycentric organization—not through central planning or pure market competition.
