### 1.13 Douglass North — Adaptive vs. Allocative Efficiency

Douglass North, Nobel-winning institutional economist, made a crucial distinction that most governance systems ignore: **allocative efficiency vs. adaptive efficiency**.

**Allocative efficiency** is what economics typically measures: optimizing resource use within existing rules. Given current institutions, regulations, and property rights, how well are resources allocated? Markets excel at this—price signals coordinate millions of decisions, capital flows to productive uses, waste gets minimized.

**Adaptive efficiency** is far more important but harder to measure: the capacity to learn and evolve better rules over time. How well does the system update its institutions when circumstances change? How quickly can it abandon failed approaches and adopt successful ones?

North's insight: **societies optimized for allocative efficiency often cannot handle adaptive challenges**. Systems that work brilliantly within stable parameters fail catastrophically when parameters shift. The very mechanisms that create allocative efficiency—property rights, contracts, regulatory frameworks, organizational structures—create **path dependence and institutional lock-in** that resist adaptation.

**Examples:**
- Kodak was allocatively efficient at film photography, but institutionally incapable of adapting to digital
- Blockbuster optimized for brick-and-mortar rental, couldn't adapt to streaming
- Detroit automakers perfected internal combustion engines, resisted electric vehicles
- Nation-states optimized for industrial-era warfare struggle with cyber and information warfare

The problem isn't incompetence—it's that the institutions, skills, power structures, and mental models that succeed in one era become barriers to the next.

**When allocative efficiency becomes pathological:** Markets can perform SO well at optimizing their objective function that they become harmful. The modern attention economy is the paradigmatic example:

- **Social media platforms** are allocatively efficient at maximizing engagement
- They've optimized content recommendation, notification timing, infinite scroll, autoplay
- The result: widespread addiction, mental health crisis, polarization, misinformation spread
- The market is working perfectly—it's just optimizing for the wrong thing

Tech giants have become so allocatively efficient at extracting attention and data that they're destroying collective wellbeing. But we can't reign them in because **regulatory capture prevents correction**. It's trivially easy to buy politicians in a plutocracy. The 2008 financial crisis demonstrated this perfectly: the banks that caused the collapse wrote the regulations meant to constrain them.

**We need adaptive efficiency: the ability to regulate markets when they overgrow.** But most modern regulation doesn't correct market failures—it sets up rent-seeking (Olson). Dodd-Frank didn't break up big banks; it created barriers that prevented new banks from forming. Tech regulation consistently protects incumbents while claiming to protect consumers.

**Why systems can't adapt:** Path dependence operates at multiple levels:
- **Economic:** Sunk costs in infrastructure, supply chains, existing capital
- **Political:** Incumbent interests resist changes that threaten their position (Olson's capture). Regulatory capture ensures correction is impossible.
- **Cognitive:** Experts trained in old paradigm can't see new possibilities (Scott's legibility problem)
- **Cultural:** Social norms and identity become invested in current ways
- **Plutocratic:** Concentrated wealth can simply purchase political outcomes, preventing reform

North's crucial insight: **systems must prioritize adaptive efficiency over allocative efficiency**. Better to have slightly suboptimal resource allocation within flexible institutions than perfect allocation within rigid ones. The ability to restructure, sunset obsolete mechanisms, and fundamentally change rules without requiring revolution or collapse determines whether civilizations adapt or collapse.
