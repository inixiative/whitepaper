### 1.5 Mancur Olson — Institutional Accretion & Interest Groups

Mancur Olson's analysis of institutional decline provides a complementary mechanism to Turchin's elite overproduction: stable democracies inevitably accumulate interest groups and regulations until they calcify into **"institutional arteriosclerosis."** Where Turchin focuses on elite demographics, Olson focuses on the structural dynamics of rules and rent-seeking coalitions.

The mechanism is straightforward: In stable societies, interest groups form around every economic activity, every regulatory domain, every source of rents. These groups lobby for rules that benefit them—occupational licensing, tariff protection, subsidies, favorable regulations. Each rule, considered individually, may be reasonable. But rules almost never sunset. They accumulate. Over decades, the regulatory thicket becomes impenetrable. New entrants can't navigate the complexity. Innovation is strangled by compliance costs. Incumbents are protected from competition. The economy ossifies.

Crucially, Olson shows this is not corruption or moral failure—it's rational self-interest combined with asymmetric incentives. Concentrated benefits (the interest group wins big) vs. diffuse costs (everyone pays a little) mean that pro-regulation lobbying always outweighs anti-regulation pressure. The Nash equilibrium is ever-increasing complexity. **Rent-seeking becomes the optimal strategy, displacing productive activity.**

This dynamic compounds over time. Societies that avoid war or revolution—the traditional mechanisms for clearing institutional deadwood—accumulate more rules, more interest groups, more sclerosis. Olson predicted that Germany and Japan, having had their institutional slates wiped clean by WWII, would outperform Britain and the US, which had accumulated a century of institutional barnacles. He was right for several decades until they too accumulated enough cruft to slow down.

**Why war is such a potent reset mechanism:** War creates overwhelming selection pressure for functional institutions. External threats force cooperation over status contests. Dysfunctional bureaucracies lose battles. Elite populations are violently reduced, addressing Turchin's overproduction problem. Rent-seeking structures are physically destroyed. Complexity is forced to simplify—only essential functions survive. Coordinated action defeats uncoordinated opponents. The problem is the catastrophic cost.

The goal of adaptive governance systems must be to achieve war's institutional benefits (clear deadwood, force cooperation, select for functionality) without war's costs (death, destruction, trauma). Automatic sunset mechanisms, lifecycle management, and elite thinning are attempts to create peaceful equivalents of war's institutional reset function.

**War's evolutionary persistence:** Despite serving individuals poorly, war remains widespread across history. Its ~80-year generational cycle suggests evolutionary value at the group selection level: population regulation, institutional reset, elite culling, and mate competition resolution. War may be evolution's brutal solution to saturation problems. **This makes peaceful alternatives urgent**—we need structures providing war's group-level benefits (institutional reset, elite thinning) without catastrophic individual costs.

**Regulatory capture completes the cycle:** The final mechanism in Olson's framework is **regulatory capture**—when interest groups gain control over the agencies that regulate them. This transforms temporary rent-seeking into permanent entrenchment. Regulators need industry expertise, so they hire from industry. Those regulators return to industry. The revolving door ensures that enforcement optimizes for industry interests rather than public welfare. Rules don't just accumulate—they're enforced by the very parties they're meant to constrain.

**Case study: 2008 financial crisis.** The crisis should have cleared institutional deadwood. Instead: big banks got bigger through consolidation, Dodd-Frank's 2,300+ pages created compliance costs only large institutions could afford, no executives were prosecuted, industry lobbyists drafted the legislation, and moral hazard was locked in through bailout precedent. Crises that should disrupt Olson's cycle instead cement it.
