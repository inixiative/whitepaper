## THEME 1: The Meta-Frame (WHY THIS MATTERS NOW)

The "best time ever" narrative is both true and dangerous. We ARE prosperous—and that prosperity comes from capabilities that our governance cannot coordinate. This theme establishes the urgency: we're at a Burkean inflection point where new technology demands new institutions, but we're stuck running godlike capabilities on medieval software.

## THEME 2: Structural Collapse Dynamics (HOW it fails)

These sections document the structural forces that drive civilizational breakdown: elite overproduction, competitive saturation, complexity overshoot, and bureaucratic metastasis. These aren't moral failures—they're predictable dynamics that emerge when systems exceed their carrying capacity.

## THEME 3: The Trap (WHY we can't fix it)

Even when we diagnose problems correctly, existing institutions cannot adapt. This theme explains the mechanisms of institutional sclerosis: interest groups accumulate and never sunset, efficiency traps prevent paradigm shifts, path dependency locks in obsolete systems, and legibility requirements destroy the local knowledge needed for wise governance. The pattern: we know what's wrong, but the system structurally cannot change.

## THEME 4: The Way Out (Proven Alternatives and Methodological Foundation)

Burke showed that technology drives institutional change. Schmachtenberger showed that governance IS technology—designed, not destiny. This theme documents what happens when we actually deploy governance innovations: George's land value tax transformed Singapore, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. Ostrom's principles sustained Swiss meadows and Spanish irrigation for centuries. Balaji's network states are emerging. The lesson: better design produces better outcomes. This isn't speculation—it's empirical fact.
