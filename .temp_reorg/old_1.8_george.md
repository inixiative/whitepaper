### 1.8 Henry George — Progress and Poverty

Henry George's *Progress and Poverty* (1879) diagnosed a fundamental paradox: why does poverty persist alongside technological progress and increasing productivity? His answer: **land rent extraction**. As societies become more productive, land values rise. Landowners capture the gains from societal progress without contributing to it. Those who own scarce resources extract rent; those who don't remain poor regardless of how hard they work or how much technology improves. Concentration leads to rent-seeking, rent-seeking leads to stagnation.

George's proposed solution—the land value tax—was radical: tax land at near-100% of its rental value, eliminate all other taxes. This would capture socially-created value (land value rises because society builds around it) while leaving productive activity untaxed. It would eliminate the incentive to hold land speculatively and force land into productive use.

**Historical implementations: Theory proven in practice**

George's ideas weren't merely theoretical—they've been implemented with measurable results. The most comprehensive adoptions show striking economic success:

**Singapore:** With 90%+ state land ownership, 99-year leaseholds, and annual land rent based on market value, Singapore implements Georgist principles at scale. The government captures land value appreciation through lease renewals while citizens enjoy productive use. Results: Efficient land use, <0.1% homelessness rate, highest GDP per capita among Asian tigers, ability to fund extensive public goods (housing, transport, healthcare) without high income taxes.

**Hong Kong:** Virtually all land government-owned with long-term leases and 3% ground rent on rateable value. Land revenue funds the majority of public infrastructure and social services. This enables Hong Kong's famously low income tax (2-17% progressive) while maintaining world-class infrastructure. The model demonstrates George's thesis: capture land value for public benefit, leave productive activity largely untaxed.

**Taiwan:** Sun Yat-sen, founding father of the Republic of China, was directly influenced by George and made "Equalization of Land Rights" foundational to his political platform. Taiwan's 1949-1953 land reforms combined with progressive urban land value taxes (1.5-6.5% on assessed value, plus 30-90% tax on future land value increments) produced dramatic results: rice yields increased 40-47% (1950-1961), overall agricultural output up 57% (1952-1962), and average farm family earnings doubled by 1965. The reforms broke land monopolies, forced idle land into production, and captured appreciation for public investment.

**Western implementations (Pennsylvania cities, Australia, Denmark, Estonia):** Multiple jurisdictions have implemented two-rate property taxes (land taxed higher than buildings) or pure land taxes. Pittsburgh operated a two-rate system from 1913-2001, taxing land at double the rate of improvements. Fifteen Pennsylvania cities adopted similar approaches. Australian states implemented land value taxes beginning in the 1880s after Henry George's 1890 lecture tour through 34 cities. Denmark maintains grundskyld (ground duty) as key revenue source. Estonia (post-1993) is the only EU country with pure land-only real estate tax, explicitly designed to encourage densification and efficient use.

**Pattern across implementations:** Where land value taxation is most comprehensive (Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan), economic outcomes are strongest. This isn't correlation without mechanism—the theory explains the results. Taxing land forces it into productive use (idle speculation becomes expensive), captures socially-created value for public benefit (infrastructure spending increases land values, which fund more infrastructure), and eliminates rent-seeking from land monopolies (those who contribute nothing can't extract value). The countries and cities that implemented George's framework most fully saw the greatest economic transformation.

**The modern parallel: Financial system rent extraction**

George's diagnosis applies to modern structures where control over money creation has replaced land as the critical scarce resource. Control the money supply, and you control who gets credit, which projects get funded, and who captures the Cantillon effect (first recipients of new money benefit most).

**Fractional reserve banking as rent extraction:** Banks create money through recursive lending—a $100 deposit becomes $1,000 in circulating currency through repeated re-lending. Central banks manipulate this process, diluting existing holdings and transferring purchasing power to first recipients. This is rent extraction through monetary policy, parallel to George's landowner class.

**The scale of financialization reveals parasitism:** Global derivatives ($600-1,000 trillion) are 6-10x larger than global GDP ($100 trillion). For every $1 of real economic activity producing goods and services, there's $10 of financial bets layered on top, each extracting fees. The financial system has become primarily parasitic.

**The growth imperative:** Modern financial structures—debt-based money, equity markets, quarterly earnings—create perpetual growth expectations. Companies that are profitable but not growing get punished by markets. This forces consolidation, demands infinite expansion on a finite planet, and eliminates "steady-state" as an option—similar to George's landowners optimizing for rent extraction over productive use.
