### 1.4 Jiang — Death by Meritocracy & Death by Bureaucracy

In two complementary YouTube lectures on his Predictive History channel—"Death by Meritocracy" (September 2020) and "Death by Bureaucracy" (October 2020)—Professor Jiang presents a unified diagnosis of institutional failure in modern democracies. Teaching high school students in Beijing, he traces how meritocratic systems create the conditions for bureaucratic metastasis, ultimately strangling the societies they claim to serve.

**Meritocracy as institutional power consolidation:** The narrative begins with Harvard. In *The Chosen: The Hidden History of Admission and Exclusion at Harvard, Yale, and Princeton*, Jerome Karabel documents how elite universities function not as merit-neutral selectors but as gatekeepers deliberately consolidating power. Harvard created the modern meritocracy for its own benefit—not to discover talent, but to control who becomes elite. The result: Harvard's endowment has skyrocketed while American democracy, social mobility, and political unity have declined. Elite institutions extract wealth from society while producing a credentialed class that serves the institution's interests rather than public welfare.

The meritocracy isn't about fairness—it's about control. A small number of institutions determine who enters the elite class. They set the criteria. They define what counts as "merit." And conveniently, the criteria they set happen to favor those already connected to elite institutions. Legacy admissions, donor preferences, and "holistic" evaluations ensure that elite reproduction continues under the guise of meritocracy. As William Deresiewicz documents in *Excellent Sheep: The Miseducation of the American Elite*, these institutions have become profoundly anti-intellectual, optimizing for credential production and status signaling rather than genuine education or discovery.

**The signaling arms race and credential inflation:** Once gatekeeping institutions establish control, rational individuals respond by over-investing in credentials. If Harvard determines who becomes elite, then getting into Harvard becomes the goal—not learning, not contribution, just the credential. This creates a signaling arms race: everyone competes to acquire the markers that institutions have deemed valuable. High school students sacrifice childhood to résumé-building. Parents spend hundreds of thousands on SAT tutoring, college consultants, and extracurriculars designed to signal "well-rounded excellence."

The predictable result is credential inflation. When everyone has a bachelor's degree, it loses signaling value, so everyone needs a master's. When everyone has a master's, everyone needs a PhD. Job postings for entry-level positions demand advanced degrees and years of experience. The credentials required for the same role increase over time while the actual work remains unchanged. Society invests exponentially more in credentialing while receiving the same or diminishing returns in productivity.

This is Turchin's elite overproduction mechanism in action: we produce far more credentialed elite aspirants than there are elite positions. The frustrated aspirants—lawyers without clients, PhDs without tenure, MBAs without executive roles—become a destabilizing force. They have the skills to organize and the motivation to challenge existing power structures. Meanwhile, incumbent elites become defensive, using regulatory capture to protect their positions. Institutions ossify as they serve elite interests rather than public welfare.

**Bureaucratic empire-building:** Here's where meritocracy transforms into bureaucracy. Drawing on Hannah Arendt's *The Origins of Totalitarianism*, Kafka's *The Trial*, and James C. Scott's *Seeing Like a State*, Jiang shows how credentialed elites create the structures that justify their existence. If you have hundreds of MBAs and no productive roles for them, what do they do? They create administrative positions. They generate process. They build bureaucracy.

**Bureaucratic empire-building** becomes the dominant strategy: bureaucrats hire subordinates to increase their own power, status, and budget security. A manager with ten direct reports has more prestige and job security than one with three. Each layer of administration creates demand for more layers—someone to coordinate the coordinators, someone to manage the managers, someone to assess the assessors. As Michael Zanini documents on his Substack (Jiang acknowledges relying heavily on Zanini's work), this pattern is visible across institutions: universities, hospitals, government agencies, corporations.

The Swedish higher education case study is illustrative: administrative staff has ballooned while faculty has stayed flat or shrunk. More administrators correlates with declining educational quality, not improving it. Each administrator adds process, compliance requirements, reporting obligations. Faculty spend more time filling out forms than teaching or researching. The nominal work (education, patient care, governance) becomes secondary to administering the administration.

This produces the **productivity paradox**: more administrators means lower organizational productivity. Coordination costs grow faster than execution gains. The more people you have coordinating, the more coordination you need. It's a self-reinforcing cycle that consumes resources while generating no value.

The system exhibits a **ratchet effect**: bureaucracies never shrink voluntarily. Each administrative layer develops its own constituency, its own budget, its own justification for existence. Trying to eliminate redundant positions triggers defensive reactions—the affected bureaucrats can articulate why they're essential (they genuinely believe it) and mobilize to protect their roles. Meanwhile, no one has strong incentive to simplify because losses are concentrated (specific people lose jobs) while gains are diffuse (everyone benefits slightly from reduced overhead). The equilibrium is perpetual growth until crisis forces simplification through collapse rather than reform.

**Why cooperation collapses:** In this environment, cooperative norms disintegrate. Meritocratic competition is zero-sum: your success is my failure. We're competing for the same scarce credentials and positions. Helping you means disadvantaging myself. Information hoarding, sabotage of rivals, and zero-sum thinking become rational strategies. David Brooks, in his Atlantic essay "The Organization Kid," describes elite students as having "no purpose beyond success itself"—perfectly prepared for institutional ladder-climbing, completely unprepared for cooperation or meaning-seeking.

The credential system rewards individual competition over collective contribution. Publishing papers becomes more important than teaching students well. Getting grants matters more than solving problems. Building your résumé outweighs building your community. The prosocial behaviors necessary for functional institutions erode as everyone optimizes individually.

**The Death of the Generalist**

Jiang's meritocracy diagnosis reveals another critical failure mode: **the credentialist arms race has systematically destroyed our capacity to produce multi-domain thinkers**. Classical liberal education aimed to create broadly educated citizens capable of reasoning across disciplines—the kind of synthesizing generalists who could integrate knowledge from economics, politics, science, and philosophy to solve complex problems. Modern credentialist systems produce the opposite: narrow specialists optimized for a single domain.

This shift is not accidental—it serves power. Narrow experts make excellent employees, but poor competitors for institutional control. A specialist who deeply understands semiconductor physics but knows nothing of economics, governance, or history cannot challenge systemic failures that span multiple domains. They can be captured by their specialty's funding streams, prestige hierarchies, and institutional incentives. Classical education taught "how to think"—a threat to authority. Modern specialization teaches "how to perform a specific function"—a useful tool.

The credential system accelerates this narrowing. To compete in the meritocratic tournament, students must demonstrate expertise depth, not breadth. Publishing 50 papers on a micro-specialization beats writing 5 papers connecting multiple fields. Academic tenure rewards staying in your lane. Professional advancement comes from domain mastery, not cross-domain synthesis. The result: we produce more credentialed experts than ever while our capacity for holistic problem-solving atrophies.

**The Dunning-Kruger amplification effect makes this worse.** The Dunning-Kruger effect traditionally describes how incompetent people overestimate their abilities. But there's a second-order effect: **competence in one domain creates illusion of competence in others**. A PhD physicist who successfully navigated complex mathematics may assume their analytical ability transfers to economics or political philosophy. Their success in a narrow domain generates confidence that their reasoning is universally applicable. Credentials compound this—society grants them authority to speak on subjects outside their expertise because they hold prestigious positions.

The result is credentialed experts confidently pronouncing on domains where they're actually novices, unaware they're pattern-matching from their home discipline rather than thinking from first principles. This explains Chris Williamson's observation (Section 2.9): "If I can predict all your views from one view, you're not a serious thinker." Credentialed specialists often adopt entire ideological packages—predetermined positions on climate, guns, taxation, healthcare, foreign policy—not through independent analysis, but because they've joined a tribe. They lack the cross-domain thinking capacity to recognize when tribal positions contradict each other or rest on weak foundations. Their narrow expertise makes them overconfident; their credentials give them platforms; and their lack of synthesis ability makes them susceptible to adopting ready-made worldviews.

**This directly amplifies Edelson's Law.** Complex civilizational problems require synthesis across domains. Nuclear energy policy demands understanding of physics, economics, political economy, materials science, regulatory dynamics, and geopolitics. Thorium reactor deployment isn't a physics problem or an economics problem—it's a synthesis problem requiring integration across multiple fields. But narrow specialists cannot make these connections. The physicist doesn't understand regulatory capture. The economist doesn't understand neutron absorption cross-sections. The political scientist doesn't understand materials engineering. Each stays in their silo, and the breakthrough that requires connecting all domains never happens.

We are missing insights exponentially (Edelson's Law) not just because institutions block them, but because **we've systematically eliminated the cognitive capacity to generate cross-domain insights in the first place**. The credentialist system selects against the very people who could solve civilizational-scale problems, replacing them with technically competent specialists who lack holistic thinking ability.

**The lawyer monoculture: cognitive mismatch with Edelson's Law.** This specialization trap manifests concretely in modern legislatures. As Turchin documents, elite overproduction of law degrees has created a political class dominated by lawyers—often 60-90% of legislators hold law degrees, compared to the mid-20th century when governance included engineers (Herbert Hoover), generals (Dwight Eisenhower), farmers, scientists, and business operators. This professional diversity enabled cognitive diversity: different modes of reasoning could be synthesized to solve complex problems.

Legal training, however, optimizes for precisely the wrong cognitive mode to solve Edelson's Law problems. Lawyers are trained in **adversarial reasoning** (truth emerges from two sides fighting, not from collaborative synthesis), **zero-sum thinking** (court cases have winners and losers, not positive-sum outcomes), and **precedent-bound logic** (answers come from past rulings, not future possibilities). This makes lawyers excellent at dividing existing resources through argument, but structurally incapable of engineering larger pies through invention.

The result: a room full of lawyers tries to **litigate** a path to fusion energy, **argue** their way to longevity breakthroughs, **negotiate** solutions to AI alignment. They treat synthesis problems—requiring integration of physics, economics, ecology, materials science—as if they were contract disputes requiring rhetorical combat and procedural maneuvering. The cognitive toolkit is fundamentally mismatched to the problem domain. You cannot solve Edelson's Law through adversarial zero-sum precedent-mining. You need engineers who think in systems, scientists who think in mechanisms, and generalists who can connect domains.

This isn't an attack on lawyers as individuals—it's recognition that **professional monoculture produces cognitive monoculture**, and cognitive monoculture cannot generate the multi-domain insights required to escape stagnation. Historical legislatures with professional diversity could synthesize military strategy, agricultural economics, industrial engineering, and scientific research into coherent policy. Modern legislatures dominated by a single profession trained in combative rhetoric cannot. We replaced a diverse governing class with a monoculture of rhetorical specialists, then wonder why governance can't solve synthesis-dependent problems.

The problem is not expertise itself—depth of knowledge is valuable and necessary. The problem is expertise without synthesis: a society of specialists with no generalists to connect their insights, trapped in epistemic fragmentation (Section 2.8) and incapable of the cross-pollination that drives genuine breakthroughs.
